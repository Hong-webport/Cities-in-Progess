# Cities-in-Progess


I've been learning many things, and busy with other stuffs, that continuing upload with the projects were hindered.

Objective: Visualize a few data variable at a time. Ambition: Commit and Code EveryDay.

Overall Objective: Use Different Type of Machine Learning Algorithm to Find Conditions and Expected Outcomes of Movies

Rough Plan:

    Use Python to Extract Companies Headquarters, and Filmmaking Locations/Year it was made, to get a csv
    test and analyse the csv files matplotlib graphs
    see if live data can be input without download
    display it in a live website with either Tableau or D3
